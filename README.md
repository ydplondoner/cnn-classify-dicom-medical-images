CNN Model To Classify DICOM Medical Images


## Description
This capstone project aims to develop an ML/AI model that detects pneumonia in medical images.
It is using data from a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/overview.
The data is in the form of DICOM format medical CT scans.

One or more models will be evaluated for performance, employing metrics F1 score and accuracy.

This project lends itself well to Convolutional Neural Networks, so three CNN architectures will be evaluated.

## Data

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data

Training data comprises of DICOM format images.  A csv file accompanies this data, labelling each
sample with a target of 1 (positive diagnosis) and 0 (negative diagnosis).
